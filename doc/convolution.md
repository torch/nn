# Convolutional layers #

A convolution is an integral that expresses the amount of overlap of one function `g` as it is shifted over another function `f`. It therefore "blends" one function with another. The neural network package supports convolution, pooling, subsampling and other relevant facilities. These are divided base on the dimensionality of the input and output [Tensors](https://github.com/torch/torch7/blob/master/doc/tensor.md#tensor):

## Temporal Modules ##
Excluding an optional first batch dimension, temporal layers expect a 2D Tensor as input. The
first dimension is the number of frames in the sequence (e.g. `nInputFrame`), the last dimenstion
is the number of features per frame (e.g. `inputFrameSize`). The output will normally have the same number
of dimensions, although the size of each dimension may change. These are commonly used for processing acoustic signals or sequences of words, i.e. in Natural Language Processing.

Note: The [LookupTable](#nn.LookupTable) is special in that while it does output a temporal Tensor of size `nOutputFrame x outputFrameSize`,
its input is a 1D Tensor of indices of size `nIndices`. Again, this is excluding the option first batch dimension.

<a name="nn.TemporalConvolution"/>
## TemporalConvolution ##

```lua
module = nn.TemporalConvolution(inputFrameSize, outputFrameSize, kW, [dW])
```

Applies a 1D convolution over an input sequence composed of `nInputFrame` frames. The `input` tensor in
`forward(input)` is expected to be a 2D tensor (`nInputFrame x inputFrameSize`) or a 3D tensor (`nBatchFrame x nInputFrame x inputFrameSize`).

The parameters are the following:
  * `inputFrameSize`: The input frame size expected in sequences given into `forward()`.
  * `outputFrameSize`: The output frame size the convolution layer will produce.
  * `kW`: The kernel width of the convolution
  * `dW`: The step of the convolution. Default is `1`.

Note that depending of the size of your kernel, several (of the last)
frames of the sequence might be lost. It is up to the user to add proper padding frames in the input
sequences.

If the input sequence is a 2D tensor of dimension `nInputFrame x inputFrameSize`, the output sequence will be
`nOutputFrame x outputFrameSize` where
```lua
nOutputFrame = (nInputFrame - kW) / dW + 1
```

If the input sequence is a 3D tensor of dimension `nBatchFrame x nInputFrame x inputFrameSize`, the output sequence will be
`nBatchFrame x nOutputFrame x outputFrameSize`.

The parameters of the convolution can be found in `self.weight` (Tensor of
size `outputFrameSize x (inputFrameSize x kW) `) and `self.bias` (Tensor of
size `outputFrameSize`). The corresponding gradients can be found in
`self.gradWeight` and `self.gradBias`.

For a 2D input, the output value of the layer can be precisely described as:
```lua
output[t][i] = bias[i]
  + sum_j sum_{k=1}^kW weight[i][j][k]
                                * input[dW*(t-1)+k)][j]
```

Here is a simple example:

```lua
inp=5;  -- dimensionality of one sequence element
outp=1; -- number of derived features for one sequence element
kw=1;   -- kernel only operates on one sequence element per step
dw=1;   -- we step once and go on to the next sequence element

mlp=nn.TemporalConvolution(inp,outp,kw,dw)

x=torch.rand(7,inp) -- a sequence of 7 elements
print(mlp:forward(x))
```
which gives:
```lua
-0.9109
-0.9872
-0.6808
-0.9403
-0.9680
-0.6901
-0.6387
[torch.Tensor of dimension 7x1]
```

This is equivalent to:
```lua
weights=torch.reshape(mlp.weight,inp) -- weights applied to all
bias= mlp.bias[1];
for i=1,x:size(1) do -- for each sequence element
   element= x[i]; -- features of ith sequence element
   print(element:dot(weights) + bias)
end
```
which gives:
```lua
-0.91094998687717
-0.98721705771773
-0.68075004276185
-0.94030132495887
-0.96798754116609
-0.69008470895581
-0.63871422284166
```

<a name="nn.TemporalMaxPooling"/>
## TemporalMaxPooling ##

```lua
module = nn.TemporalMaxPooling(kW, [dW])
```

Applies 1D max-pooling operation in `kW` regions by step size
`dW` steps. Input sequence composed of `nInputFrame` frames. The `input` tensor in
`forward(input)` is expected to be a 2D tensor (`nInputFrame x inputFrameSize`)
or a 3D tensor (`nBatchFrame x nInputFrame x inputFrameSize`).

If the input sequence is a 2D tensor of dimension `nInputFrame x inputFrameSize`, the output sequence will be
`nOutputFrame x inputFrameSize` where
```lua
nOutputFrame = (nInputFrame - kW) / dW + 1
```

<a name="nn.TemporalSubSampling"/>
## TemporalSubSampling ##

```lua
module = nn.TemporalSubSampling(inputFrameSize, kW, [dW])
```

Applies a 1D sub-sampling over an input sequence composed of `nInputFrame` frames. The `input` tensor in
`forward(input)` is expected to be a 2D tensor (`nInputFrame x inputFrameSize`). The output frame size
will be the same as the input one (`inputFrameSize`).

The parameters are the following:
  * `inputFrameSize`: The input frame size expected in sequences given into `forward()`.
  * `kW`: The kernel width of the sub-sampling
  * `dW`: The step of the sub-sampling. Default is `1`.

Note that depending of the size of your kernel, several (of the last)
frames of the sequence might be lost. It is up to the user to add proper padding frames in the input
sequences.

If the input sequence is a 2D tensor `nInputFrame x inputFrameSize`, the output sequence will be
`inputFrameSize x nOutputFrame` where
```lua
nOutputFrame = (nInputFrame - kW) / dW + 1
```

The parameters of the sub-sampling can be found in `self.weight` (Tensor of
size `inputFrameSize`) and `self.bias` (Tensor of
size `inputFrameSize`). The corresponding gradients can be found in
`self.gradWeight` and `self.gradBias`.

The output value of the layer can be precisely described as:
```lua
output[i][t] = bias[i] + weight[i] * sum_{k=1}^kW input[i][dW*(t-1)+k)]
```

<a name="nn.LookupTable"/>
## LookupTable ##

```lua
module = nn.LookupTable(nIndex, sizes)
```
or
```lua
module = nn.LookupTable(nIndex, size1, [size2], [size3], ...)
```

This layer is a particular case of a convolution, where the width of the convolution would be `1`.
When calling `forward(input)`, it assumes `input` is a 1D or 2D tensor filled with indices.
If the input is a matrix, then each row is assumed to be an input sample of given batch. Indices start
at `1` and can go up to `nIndex`. For each index, it outputs a corresponding `Tensor` of size
specified by `sizes` (a `LongStorage`) or `size1 x size2 x...`.

Given a 1D input, the output tensors are concatenated,
generating a `n x size1 x size2 x ... x sizeN` tensor, where `n`
is the size of a 1D `input` tensor.

Again with a 1D input, when only `size1` is provided, the `forward(input)` is equivalent to
performing the following matrix-matrix multiplication in an efficient manner:
```lua
M P
```
where `M` is a 2D matrix `size1 x nIndex` containing the parameters of the lookup-table and
`P` is a 2D matrix, where each column vector `i` is a zero vector except at index `input[i]` where it is `1`.

1D example:
```lua
 -- a lookup table containing 10 tensors of size 3
 module = nn.LookupTable(10, 3)

 input = torch.Tensor{1,2,1,10}
 print(module:forward(input))
```

Outputs something like:
```lua
-1.4415 -0.1001 -0.1708
-0.6945 -0.4350  0.7977
-1.4415 -0.1001 -0.1708
-0.0745  1.9275  1.0915
[torch.DoubleTensor of dimension 4x3]
```
Note that the first row vector is the same as the 3rd one!

Given a 2D input tensor of size `m x n`, the output is a `m x n x size1 x size2 x ... x sizeN`
tensor, where `m` is the number of samples in
the batch and `n` is the number of indices per sample.

2D example:
```lua
 -- a lookup table containing 10 tensors of size 3
 module = nn.LookupTable(10, 3)

 -- a batch of 2 samples of 4 indices each
 input = torch.Tensor({{1,2,4,5},{4,3,2,10}})
 print(module:forward(input))
```

Outputs something like:
```lua
(1,.,.) =
 -0.0570 -1.5354  1.8555
 -0.9067  1.3392  0.6275
  1.9662  0.4645 -0.8111
  0.1103  1.7811  1.5969

(2,.,.) =
  1.9662  0.4645 -0.8111
  0.0026 -1.4547 -0.5154
 -0.9067  1.3392  0.6275
 -0.0193 -0.8641  0.7396
[torch.DoubleTensor of dimension 2x4x3]
```

<a name="nn.SpatialModules"/>
## Spatial Modules ##
Excluding and optional batch dimension, spatial layers expect a 3D Tensor as input. The
first dimension is the number of features (e.g. `frameSize`), the last two dimenstions
are spatial (e.g. `height x width`). These are commonly used for processing images.

<a name="nn.SpatialConvolution"/>
### SpatialConvolution ###

```lua
module = nn.SpatialConvolution(nInputPlane, nOutputPlane, kW, kH, [dW], [dH], [padding])
```

Applies a 2D convolution over an input image composed of several input planes. The `input` tensor in
`forward(input)` is expected to be a 3D tensor (`nInputPlane x height x width`).

The parameters are the following:
  * `nInputPlane`: The number of expected input planes in the image given into `forward()`.
  * `nOutputPlane`: The number of output planes the convolution layer will produce.
  * `kW`: The kernel width of the convolution
  * `kH`: The kernel height of the convolution
  * `dW`: The step of the convolution in the width dimension. Default is `1`.
  * `dH`: The step of the convolution in the height dimension. Default is `1`.
  * `padding`: The additional zeros added per side to the input planes. Default is `0`, a good number is `(kernelSize-1)/2` for square kernels.

Note that depending of the size of your kernel, several (of the last)
columns or rows of the input image might be lost. It is up to the user to
add proper padding in images.

If the input image is a 3D tensor `nInputPlane x height x width`, the output image size
will be `nOutputPlane x oheight x owidth` where
```lua
owidth  = floor((width  + 2*padding - kW) / dW + 1)
oheight = floor((height + 2*padding - kH) / dH + 1)
```

The parameters of the convolution can be found in `self.weight` (Tensor of
size `nOutputPlane x nInputPlane x kH x kW`) and `self.bias` (Tensor of
size `nOutputPlane`). The corresponding gradients can be found in
`self.gradWeight` and `self.gradBias`.

The output value of the layer can be precisely described as:
```lua
output[i][j][k] = bias[k]
  + sum_l sum_{s=1}^kW sum_{t=1}^kH weight[s][t][l][k]
                                    * input[dW*(i-1)+s)][dH*(j-1)+t][l]
```


<a name="nn.SpatialConvolutionMap"/>
### SpatialConvolutionMap ###

```lua
module = nn.SpatialConvolutionMap(connectionMatrix, kW, kH, [dW], [dH])
```

This class is a generalization of
[nn.SpatialConvolution](#nn.SpatialConvolution). It uses a generic
connection table between input and output features. The
[nn.SpatialConvolution](#nn.SpatialConvolution) is equivalent to
using a [full connection table](#nn.tables.full). One can specify
different types of connection tables.

<a name="nn.tables.full"/>
#### Full Connection Table ####

```lua
table = nn.tables.full(nin,nout)
```

This is a precomputed table that specifies connections between every
input and output node.

<a name="nn.tables.onetoone"/>
#### One to One Connection Table ####

```lua
table = nn.tables.oneToOne(n)
```

This is a precomputed table that specifies a single connection to each
output node from corresponding input node.

<a name="nn.tables.random"/>
#### Random Connection Table ####

```lua
table = nn.tables.random(nin,nout, nto)
```

This table is randomly populated such that each output unit has
`nto` incoming connections. The algorihtm tries to assign uniform
number of outgoing connections to each input node if possible.

<a name="nn.SpatialLPPooling"/>
### SpatialLPPooling ###

```lua
module = nn.SpatialLPPooling(nInputPlane, pnorm, kW, kH, [dW], [dH])
```

Computes the `p` norm in a convolutional manner on a set of 2D input planes.

<a name="nn.SpatialMaxPooling"/>
### SpatialMaxPooling ###

```lua
module = nn.SpatialMaxPooling(kW, kH [, dW, dH])
```

Applies 2D max-pooling operation in `kWxkH` regions by step size
`dWxdH` steps. The number of output features is equal to the number of
input planes.

<a name="nn.SpatialAveragePooling"/>
### SpatialAveragePooling ###

```lua
module = nn.SpatialAveragePooling(kW, kH [, dW, dH])
```

`dWxdH` steps. The number of output features is equal to the number of
input planes.

<a name="nn.SpatialAdaptiveMaxPooling"/>
### SpatialAdaptiveMaxPooling ###

```lua
module = nn.SpatialAdaptiveMaxPooling(W, H)
```

Applies 2D max-pooling operation in an image such that the output is of
size `WxH`, for any input size. The number of output features is equal
to the number of input planes.

For an output of dimensions `(owidth,oheight)`, the indexes of the pooling
region `(j,i)` in the input image of dimensions `(iwidth,iheight)` are
given by:

```lua
x_j_start = floor((j   /owidth)  * iwidth)
x_j_end   = ceil(((j+1)/owidth)  * iwidth)

y_i_start = floor((i   /oheight) * iheight)
y_i_end   = ceil(((i+1)/oheight) * iheight)
```

<a name="nn.SpatialSubSampling"/>
### SpatialSubSampling ###

```lua
module = nn.SpatialSubSampling(nInputPlane, kW, kH, [dW], [dH])
```

Applies a 2D sub-sampling over an input image composed of several input planes. The `input` tensor in
`forward(input)` is expected to be a 3D tensor (`nInputPlane x height x width`). The number of output
planes will be the same as `nInputPlane`.

The parameters are the following:
  * `nInputPlane`: The number of expected input planes in the image given into `forward()`.
  * `kW`: The kernel width of the sub-sampling
  * `kH`: The kernel height of the sub-sampling
  * `dW`: The step of the sub-sampling in the width dimension. Default is `1`.
  * `dH`: The step of the sub-sampling in the height dimension. Default is `1`.

Note that depending of the size of your kernel, several (of the last)
columns or rows of the input image might be lost. It is up to the user to
add proper padding in images.

If the input image is a 3D tensor `nInputPlane x height x width`, the output image size
will be `nInputPlane x oheight x owidth` where

```lua
owidth  = (width  - kW) / dW + 1
oheight = (height - kH) / dH + 1 .
```

The parameters of the sub-sampling can be found in `self.weight` (Tensor of
size `nInputPlane`) and `self.bias` (Tensor of size `nInputPlane`). The
corresponding gradients can be found in `self.gradWeight` and
`self.gradBias`.

The output value of the layer can be precisely described as:
```lua
output[i][j][k] = bias[k]
  + weight[k] sum_{s=1}^kW sum_{t=1}^kH input[dW*(i-1)+s)][dH*(j-1)+t][k]
```

<a name="nn.SpatialUpSamplingNearest"/>
### SpatialUpSamplingNearest ###

```lua
module = nn.SpatialUpSamplingNearest(scale)
```

Applies a 2D up-sampling over an input image composed of several input planes. The `input` tensor in
`forward(input)` is expected to be a 3D or 4D tensor (i.e. for 4D: `nBatchPlane x nInputPlane x height x width`). The number of output planes will be the same.  The v dimension is assumed to be the second last dimension (i.e. for 4D it will be the 3rd dim), and the u dimension is assumed to be the last dimension.

The parameters are the following:
  * `scale`: The upscale ratio.  Must be a positive integer

The up-scaling method is simple nearest neighbor, ie:

```lua
output(u,v) = input(floor((u-1)/scale)+1, floor((v-1)/scale)+1)
```

Where `u` and `v` are index from 1 (as per lua convention).  There are no learnable parameters.

<a name="nn.SpatialZeroPadding"/>
### SpatialZeroPadding ###

```lua
module = nn.SpatialZeroPadding(padLeft, padRight, padTop, padBottom)
```

Each feature map of a given input is padded with specified number of
zeros. If padding values are negative, then input is cropped.

<a name="nn.SpatialSubtractiveNormalization"/>
### SpatialSubtractiveNormalization ###

```lua
module = nn.SpatialSubtractiveNormalization(ninputplane, kernel)
```

Applies a spatial subtraction operation on a series of 2D inputs using
`kernel` for computing the weighted average in a neighborhood. The
neighborhood is defined for a local spatial region that is the size as
kernel and across all features. For a an input image, since there is
only one feature, the region is only spatial. For an RGB image, the
weighted anerage is taken over RGB channels and a spatial region.

If the `kernel` is 1D, then it will be used for constructing and seperable
2D kernel. The operations will be much more efficient in this case.

The kernel is generally chosen as a gaussian when it is believed that
the correlation of two pixel locations decrease with increasing
distance. On the feature dimension, a uniform average is used since
the weighting across features is not known.

For this example we use an external package
[image](http://www.github.com/clementfarabet/lua---image/)

```lua
require 'image'
require 'nn'
lena = image.rgb2y(image.lena())
ker = torch.ones(11)
m=nn.SpatialSubtractiveNormalization(1,ker)
processed = m:forward(lena)
w1=image.display(lena)
w2=image.display(processed)
```
![](image/lena.jpg)![](image/lenap.jpg)

<a name="nn.SpatialBatchNormalization"/>
## SpatialBatchNormalization ##

`module` = `nn.SpatialBatchNormalization(N [,eps] [, momentum])`
 where N = number of input feature maps
giving N = 0 disables the learnable affine transform.
eps is a small value added to the standard-deviation to avoid divide-by-zero. Defaults to 1e-5

Implements Batch Normalization as described in the paper:
   "Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training
                         by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift"
                   by Sergey Ioffe, Christian Szegedy

The operation implemented is:
```
   y =     ( x - mean(x) )
        -------------------- * gamma + beta
       standard-deviation(x)
```
where the mean and standard-deviation are calculated per feature-map over the mini-batches and pixels
and where gamma and beta are learnable parameter vectors of size N (where N = number of feature maps).
The learning of gamma and beta is optional.

   In training time, this layer keeps a running estimate of it's computed mean and std.
   The running sum is kept with a default momentup of 0.1 (unless over-ridden)
   In test time, this running mean/std is used to normalize.



The module only accepts 4D inputs.

```lua
-- with learnable parameters
model = nn.SpatialBatchNormalization(m)
A = torch.randn(b, m, h, w)
C = model.forward(A)  -- C will be of size `b x m x h x w`

-- without learnable parameters
model = nn.SpatialBatchNormalization(0)
A = torch.randn(b, m, h, w)
C = model.forward(A)  -- C will be of size `b x m x h x w`
```

<a name="nn.VolumetricModules"/>
## Volumetric Modules ##
Excluding and optional batch dimension, volumetric layers expect a 4D Tensor as input. The
first dimension is the number of features (e.g. `frameSize`), the second is sequential (e.g. `time`) and the
last two dimenstions are spatial (e.g. `height x width`). These are commonly used for processing videos (sequences of images).

<a name="nn.VolumetricConvolution"/>
### VolumetricConvolution ###

```lua
module = nn.VolumetricConvolution(nInputPlane, nOutputPlane, kT, kW, kH [, dT, dW, dH])
```

Applies a 3D convolution over an input image composed of several input planes. The `input` tensor in
`forward(input)` is expected to be a 4D tensor (`nInputPlane x time x height x width`).

The parameters are the following:
  * `nInputPlane`: The number of expected input planes in the image given into `forward()`.
  * `nOutputPlane`: The number of output planes the convolution layer will produce.
  * `kT`: The kernel size of the convolution in time
  * `kW`: The kernel width of the convolution
  * `kH`: The kernel height of the convolution
  * `dT`: The step of the convolution in the time dimension. Default is `1`.
  * `dW`: The step of the convolution in the width dimension. Default is `1`.
  * `dH`: The step of the convolution in the height dimension. Default is `1`.

Note that depending of the size of your kernel, several (of the last)
columns or rows of the input image might be lost. It is up to the user to
add proper padding in images.

If the input image is a 4D tensor `nInputPlane x time x height x width`, the output image size
will be `nOutputPlane x otime x owidth x oheight` where
```lua
otime   = (time  - kT)  / dT + 1
owidth  = (width  - kW) / dW + 1
oheight = (height - kH) / dH + 1 .
```

The parameters of the convolution can be found in `self.weight` (Tensor of
size `nOutputPlane x nInputPlane x kT x kH x kW`) and `self.bias` (Tensor of
size `nOutputPlane`). The corresponding gradients can be found in
`self.gradWeight` and `self.gradBias`.

<a name="nn.VolumetricMaxPooling"/>
### VolumetricMaxPooling ###

```lua
module = nn.VolumetricMaxPooling(kT, kW, kH [, dT, dW, dH])
```

Applies 3D max-pooling operation in `kTxkWxkH` regions by step size
`dTxdWxdH` steps. The number of output features is equal to the number of
input planes / dT.
